# Defining the distance between procedures using SNOMED CT embeddings

A modification of https://github.com/TSChang-Lab/disease_distance_KGE. The idea is to see if this approach also works for OPCS procedure codes.

## Data description
### Disease distance files
Locate in the folder /disease_distance_metrics

1. **ICD_Distance_short.txt**

Include all pairwise distances of ICD-10 codes, including knowledge-graph embedding-based (embed_dist), ICD-10 tree-based (naive_dist), comorbidity-based (jaccard_dist), and genetic correlation-based (gen_dist). Also include the study type that the genetic correlation results based on.

2. **ICD_Distance_full.txt**

In addition to **ICD_Distance_short.txt**, adding more information for each pair, including the number of cases in UCLA EHR (N1/N2/N_pairs), raw genetic correlation (gen_cor) and its cooresponding standard deviation (gen_cor_sd), confidence of the correlation estimation (d1_confidence/d2_confidence), and heritability estimation for each ICD (h2_D1/h2_D2).
